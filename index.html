                    <p>I am currently a senior at University at Buffalo pursuing bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
                        I expect to graduate in 2023. I am passionate about computer software and computer programming languages. 
                        I really enjoy programming frontend, backend, software and making websites. I am still in the process of learning 
                        React and C. However, I have good knowledge on Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Java, C and MySQL. 
                        I also have experience working in VS code, IntelliJ, and GitHub. I enhance my programming skill day by day. I also 
                        have great skills on problem solving, communication, and have experience working in a team. I am currently looking 
                        for a job to apply my skills and I would be happy to talk in person about my qualifications, so feel free to shoot me an email!</p>
